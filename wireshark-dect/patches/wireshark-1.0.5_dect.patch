+Description:
+============
+DECT pcap files can be obtained by using tools coming with the linux
+kernel driver for the Dosch-and-Amand COM-ON-AIR cards. The driver is
+called com-on-air_cs.
+
+Wireshark itself cannot directy record from the DECT HW, as the driver
+currently lacks a virtual network interface.
+
+To nicely view DECT pcap files in wireshark, set up a custom layout:

+# We do this by scanning sources.  If that turns out to be too slow,

+# DISSECTOR_SRC is assumed to have all the files that need to be scanned.

+# For some unknown reason, having a big "for" loop in the Makefile

+# pass only the first few names in the list to the shell, for some
+# reason.
+#
+# Therefore, we have a script to generate the plugin.c file.

+# for each input file; this is especially slow on Windows.  Therefore,
+# if Python is present (as indicated by PYTHON being defined), we run
+# a faster Python script to do that work instead.
+#
+# The first argument is the directory in which the source files live.
+# The second argument is "plugin", to indicate that we should build
+# a plugin.c file for a plugin.
+# All subsequent arguments are the files to scan.

+#
+# Oh, yuk.  We don't want to include "plugin.c" in the distribution, as
+# its contents depend on the configuration, and therefore we want it
+# to be built when the first "make" is done; however, Automake insists
